The Trajectory Iterative pKa Predictor (TrIPP) 
Written by: Christos Matsingos, Ka Fu Man, and Arianna Fornili 

If you are using TrIPP, please cite: 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Trajectory class initialised:
Your topology file contains no chain identity for at least one atom. 
Will add chain A for your whole system by default
Your topology file contains no formal charges. 
Will set formal charges to 0 for your whole system by default.
Resname and record type check passed.

Terminal oxygens will be modified with our predefined dictionary:
LEU129: OC1 -> O, OC2 -> OXT
Terminal oxygen check passed, involving: 
LEU129
