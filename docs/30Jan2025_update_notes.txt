Major update for multichain system:
1. User required to assign chain ID manually in their topology file for multichain system.
    - check if duplicated number found in the resid for their topology.
    - prevent same resid but in two different chain selected in any of our code.

2. Fixed pKa and buriedness extraction for multichain system.
    - chain parameter can take in single or double chain.
    - csv file will be saved individually.

3. Coupled residue might appear in pKa predictions:
    - added an alert in the log file if this appear in PROPKA prediction.

4. (beta) Detection of terminal oxygen should now account for multichain.

5. Resindices rather than resid in our internal code:
    - prevent same resid but in two different chain selected in any of our code.

6. Residues parameter changed to selections:
    - user needs to specify the MDAnalysis selection for clustering analysis.
    - prevent using resid

7. Calculate_difference_to_model() function paramter changed:
    - user needs to provide the path to the pka csv file.

8. Mutation is now done through MDAnalysis universe, rather than replacing file directly:
    - mutation_selection parameter require user to select residue in MDAnalysis selection algebra
      rather than resid
    - allow double mutation in two chains
    - account for AMBER and CHARMM forcefield (name H and name HN)

Minor update:
1. Removed redundant codes and files:
    - edit_pdb()
    - _missing_data_recovery.py
    - etc.

2. Added try and except in the automated silhouette score evalutation.
