    "* **1AKI_minstr.pdb**: energy minimised structure in PDB format (1960 atoms)\n",
    "* **1AKI_md1_300ns.xtc** and **1AKI_md2_300ns.xtc**: trajectory files of two 308.5-ns replicas in xtc format (frames are sampled every 100 ps, water molecules and counterions have been removed, the system is composed of a single-chain protein with no ligand)\n",

    "1. PROPKA only recognizes specific residue names (for the standard 20 amino acids).\n",
    "2. The names of the two C-terminal oxygen atoms need to be O and OXT.\n",
    "3. The record type of non-protein atoms (e.g., a ligand) needs to be 'HETATM'.\n",

    "TrIPP has a hard-coded dictionary (tripp.\\_correction_dictionary_.py) that converts a list of standard residue names recognised by MDanalysis (https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/standard_selections.html) to names compatible with PROPKA. A dictionary is also used to convert C-terminal oxygen atom names used in the GROMOS, AMBER or CHARMM force fields to the PROPKA format. \n",

    "#### *** to be changed, but it's unclear to me what it means!\n",

    "Although this analysis is presented at the end of the tutorial, for new systems without prior knowledge of key residues, it may be useful to perform it early to identify residues whose p*K*<sub>a</sub> values could be correlated with functional motions."
