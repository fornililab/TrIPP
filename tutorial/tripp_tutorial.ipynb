    "* **1AKI_minstr.pdb**: energy minimised structure in PDB format (1960 atoms)\n",
    "* **1AKI_md1_300ns.xtc** and **1AKI_md2_300ns.xtc**: trajectory files of two 308.5-ns replicas in xtc format (frames are sampled every 100 ps, water molecules and counterions have been removed, the system is composed of a single-chain protein with no ligand)\n",

    "1. PROPKA only recognizes specific residue names (for the standard 20 amino acids).\n",
    "2. The names of the two C-terminal oxygen atoms need to be O and OXT.\n",
    "3. The record type of non-protein atoms (e.g., a ligand) needs to be 'HETATM'.\n",
    "\n",
    "TrIPP has a hard-coded dictionary (tripp.\\_correction_dictionary_.py) that converts a list of standard residue names recognised by [MDAnalysis](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/standard_selections.html) to names compatible with PROPKA. A dictionary is also used to convert C-terminal oxygen atom names used in the GROMOS, AMBER or CHARMM force fields to the PROPKA format. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this conversion, TrIPP checks if residue names or C-terminal oxygen atom names that cannot be recognised by PROPKA are still present:\n",
